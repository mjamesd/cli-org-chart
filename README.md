## Description
A CLI content management system for a business organizational chart written in Express.js and Node.js. It utilizes asynchronous JavaScript functions and performs all CRUD functions (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on each asset type: departments, roles, and employees. Users can also view employees by manager and by department. Users can also see the total utilized budget of all departments &mdash; in other words, the combined salaries of all employees in each department. The app uses the `Inquirer`, `MySQL2`, and `console.table` Node.js packages.

## Installation

To start using the org chart, first clone the repo to your server. Then run `npm i` to install all the dependent packages.

Next, open `connection.js` in the `connection` folder. Change the MySQL user and password to your own MySQL server credentials. Next, look in the "sql" folder. In MySQL, run the SQL statements in `schema.sql`. Then, if desired, run the statements in `seed.sql` to add test data to the database.
